## App Brainstorming

Favorite Apps:
- Reddit
  - Sort options for posts (new, top for x period, trending, etc.)

  - Intuitive UI for placing trades
- ESPN
  - Favorite teams are prioritized for the scores section

App I'd Like to Build:
  - Collector Tracking App - an app designed for enthusiasts who enjoy collecting items no matter what the items are
    - Features:
      - Custom categories: Users can create the category to track (cards, shoes, vintage items, etc.)
      - Scanning feature: The ability to scan barcodes to identify items and add them to a collection
      - Wishlists: To track the items the user has yet to acquire for their collection
      - Social/Community: a forum to engage with other enthusiasts and potentially buy from or trade with others
      - Value tracking: Get estimates on the value of the items you have based on their rarity, condition, etc.


## Notes

Challenges while building the app:

The app was straightforward to build. I think the most challenging part was navigating Xcode and figuring out where different tools/options were located.
